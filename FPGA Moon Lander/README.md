FPGA Moon Lander — SystemVerilog, Verilator, FPGA Demo
=====================================================

GitHub Repo Description (Short)
-------------------------------

FPGA implementation of a Moon Lander game using SystemVerilog. Includes throttle control, fuel/altitude tracking, collision detection, and hardware demo. Verified in Verilator.

Full Description
----------------

A hardware-implemented Moon Lander simulation built entirely in SystemVerilog. Features include throttle control, real-time fuel and altitude tracking, safe-landing/crash logic, and display output.

Key Features
------------

- Fully synchronous SystemVerilog design
- Real-time altitude, fuel, and velocity tracking
- Collision and safe-landing detection logic
- Verified using Verilator testbenches
- Demonstrated running on FPGA hardware

Tools
-----

SystemVerilog, Verilator, Vivado/Quartus, FPGA board
